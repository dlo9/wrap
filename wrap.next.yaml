# Invoking `wrap install` will automatically install these aliases in your shell.
# To uninstall, run `wrap uninstall`. Both may require restarting your shell to take effect.

# All aliases have a `--dry-run` flag which, when invoked, will print the command instead of running it

# TODO: rewrite
# Variables will be expanded when used as an argument value
# Invoking an argument can be done with POSIX shell syntax:
#   - Typical use: $MY_VARIABLE
#   - Variable with text immediately following: ${MY_VARIABLE}_with_some_text
#   - Tilde expansion: ~/file_in_my_home_directory.txt
#
# Variables in arguments can be from here, the environment, or positional arguments. Environment
# variables take precedence over config variables. If a variable does not exist, it will expand
# into the empty string.
variables:

  # Any number of variables can be defined
  # Like POSIX shell, variables must match `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]+`
  DEV_DOMAIN: dev.domain.com
  KAFKA_1: kafka-broker-1
  KAFKA_2: kafka-broker-2

  # Variables may contain previously defined variables
  # Like POSIX shell variables can expand with `$NAME` or `${NAME}`
